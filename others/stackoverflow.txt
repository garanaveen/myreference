How to use QProcess::startDetached with setStandardOutputFile()

I have a process which is supposed to start another process and am using QProcess::startDetached() as there is no relationship to the forked process. Now I am trying to figure out a way to redirect the stdout to a file. 
When I use setStandardOutputFile() with QProcess::startDetached the redirection to file doesn't work. 
While setStandardOutputFile() works fine with QProcess::start().

I thought since QProcess::startDetached() is the static method, it might not work with setStandardOutputFile() but I saw this statement in QProcess documentation,

---------
Only the following property setters are supported by startDetached():
setArguments()
setCreateProcessArgumentsModifier()
setStandardOutputFile()
...
---------

Trying to understand what this statement means in the documentation.

Gist of code,
void ForkProcess()
{
QProcess processObj;
processObj.setStandardOutputFile("/tmp/stdoutfile.txt");
processObj.startDetached(processWithArguments);
}
