How to connect Brothers printer to WiFi
Network->WLAN->SetupWizard
Choose network from the list and for entering password just keep pressing uparrow and ok button until the required letter is reached.
Tried to do WiFi-Direct and couldn't succeed.

Print Network Config so that you can add a printer with its ipaddress,
Menu -> MachineInfo -> Network Config -> Print
Once you know the ipaddress, open "Printers & Scanners" on mac and choose ipaddress. Enter the ipaddress and the printer should become available for printing from mac.
