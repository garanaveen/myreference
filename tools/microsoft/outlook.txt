How to create a out of office (OOO) appointment to inform your team members?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. NewMeeting
2. FillSubjectAndStartAndEndTime
3. Attendees->ResponseOptions->ClearRequestResponses
4. Options->ShowAs->Free (This is so that you don't block the time for all the participants.)
5. Add your team members and Send

PS : If you want your OOO time to be blocked so that no one can create an appointment with you as you are OOO, create another personal appointment with ShowAs-Busy
