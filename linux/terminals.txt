tilda is xterm kind of terminal which doesn't have any kind of titlebar. Could be best used on an external monitor for say logging.
sudo apt-get install tilda # This is a full scree terminal with no straightforward way to resize the screen. I didn't like it.

sudo apt-get install tilix # Change the theme to dark. 3horizontallines->Preferences->Appearance->ThemeVariant->RestartTheTerminal

sudo apt-get install terminator #Wonderful choice if you want to split the terminal.
