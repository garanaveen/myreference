How to restart hung wdmycloud via ssh?

shutdown.sh

When I did this, I ended up with this message when I tried to visit this link - http://wdmycloudmirror.local/
Power was lost from the system. Performing file system consistency check. Please wait.
I was able to do ssh right away. I was able to connect with that link after a while though.

It's a good idea to schedule restarts every day at 5AM. This will let the device fix itself if I just wait till the next day.

***** DO NOT USE HALT *****
Use shutdown.sh as some have already suggested. This is not the same Linux shutdown, it is a shell script that executes many procedures before shutting the device down. Otherwise, you are very likely to corrupt your disks and losing data.
