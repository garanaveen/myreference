You can enable whitespace trimming at file save time from settings:

Open Visual Studio Code User Settings (menu File → Preferences → Settings → User Settings tab).
Click the enter image description here icon in the top-right part of the window. This will open a document.
Add a new "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true setting to the User Settings document if it's not already there. This is so you aren't editing the Default Setting directly, but instead adding to it.
Save the User Settings file.
We also added a new command to trigger this manually (Trim Trailing Whitespace from the command palette).
