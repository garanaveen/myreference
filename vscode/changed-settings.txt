File->Preferences->Setings->Workbench->Appearance->ColorCustomizations->EditInSettings.json

"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "[Name of the Current Theme you are using]": {

    },
},
"window.titleBarStyle": "custom"


--------------------

With the default theme in vscode, on the tab where all opened files are shown, visually there is no easy way to figure out which is the file that is opened. You can change the color of current file by adding the following to settings.json

File -> Preferences -> Settings
Workbench: Color Customizations -> Edit in settings.json
This should open up settings.json file.
Add these lines.

        "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
          "tab.activeBackground": "#0A84FF",
        },
        "window.titleBarStyle": "custom"

--------------------

"Go to Definition" changed from "F12 to F2"
