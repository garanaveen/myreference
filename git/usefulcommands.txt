4. Create a branch called SpecificFeature on the tip of release branch.
5. Cherry pick the commit on to the SpecificFeature branch
6. Drag and drop the SpecificFeature on to the release branch. Choose "Push SpecificFeature and make a pull request to canon/release"
7. Go to canon and see if there are any pull requests. If yes thats all.
