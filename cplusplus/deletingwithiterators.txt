Deleting elements from STL set while iterating,
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2874441/deleting-elements-from-stl-set-while-iterating
When you delete items while iterating them, it would invalidate the iterator and would fail when you try to move to the next item.

This was solved in C++ by making erase return the iterator to the next item.

for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ) {
    if (*it % 2 == 0) {
        it = numbers.erase(it); //Here you move to next iterator.
    }
    else {
        ++it;
    }
}
