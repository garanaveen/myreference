CppCon 2019 Presentations

Hello fellow C++ developers,
 
Way back in September of 2019, 4 developers went to CppCon 2019 to see what was new in C++ and learn more interesting things we can do with C++.  We attended many presentations over the course of a week and came back with several different insights as to what we learned and what is coming soon to C++.  This email is a guide to some of the best presentations we saw at CppCon 2019:

All presentations for CppCon 2019 can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTh1InhhwT6KhvViwRiTR7I5s09dLCSw
 
It should be noted that Gen4 code is limited to C++14 currently, so while there are some nice additions to C++17 and C++20, they are not available currently.  Hopefully that will change in the near future.
 
Thanks!
