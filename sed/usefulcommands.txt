Remove unicode (non-ascii) characters from a file,
iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii file.txt

Simple substitute,
sed 's/incorrect/correct/g' file.txt > newfile.txt

Delete lines that match,
sed '/DeleteString/d' file.txt


Delete lines that are shorter than X characters in-place,
sed --regexp-extended --in-place '/^.{,30}$/d' file.txt #Backup the original file as this replaces it!
